# ToDo-List
A simple To-Do List console Application written in java.
INSTALLATION
As easy as unzipping and opening up in netbeans to see your effect or you can even build the source code from src/FileOperation directory.

Works flawlessly in linux Os.Don't know about MacOs/Windows but even in these need just tinkering of file location.
By default, your To-Do List file will be named after your Name and will be placed in ~/Documents directory.
